One day a crow stood on a branch near his nest and felt very happy with the meat in his mouth.
At that time，a fox saw the crow with the meat，so he swallowed and eagerly thought of a plan to get the meat.
However，whatever the fox said to the crow，the crow just kept silent.
Until the fox thought highly of the crow s beautiful voice，the crow felt flattered and opened his mouth to sing.
As soon as the meat fell down to the ground，the fox took the meat and went into his hole.
